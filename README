This is my entry to Google AI Challenge 2011 (Ants).

The bot is using influence fields for combat. Credit to Memetix for sharing his combat idea which made an improvement to my bot's combat.

Potential field diffusion is used for food gethering, exploration, and hill attack. Also, the same approach is used to maintain visibility of the whole explored space.

Thanks contest organizers and all participants for the great competition!
